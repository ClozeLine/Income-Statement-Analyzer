# Income Statement Analzer

## Graph income data from any company. 

This is by no means a professional project, just something put together to test out a free version of an API.

This program uses:
- [FMP's API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs)
- [CustomTKinter](https://felipetesc.github.io/CtkDocs/#/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)

## How it works:
You first enter the ticker symbol of the company you wish to evaluate

Three types of data is available to plot:
1. <u>**Currency:**</u> For metrics over 1000$
2. Ratio: Scales in between 0 - 1
3. Number: For metrics under 1000$

Graph can be created from any three, the graph will update and replace the last each time one is created.
